###This file contains the instructions to run the MHD code. 

##List of files required to run the MHD code
main.cpp - contains the initial settings required to run simulations; first file to open to ammend initial settings!
array.cpp - contains the function defining data structure used in the MHD code
system_MHD.cpp - contains iteration function and initial data for different MHD test cases
eos_MHD.cpp - contains the MHD specific flux functions and variable conversion functions
numerical_method_MHD.cpp - contains the HLLC solver; FORCE solver for MHD

##Additional files for extra analysis 
convergence.cpp - contains the function to calculate error and convergence rate
RiemannExactSol.cpp - contains the functions to calculate the exact solution for 1-D Euler

##Steps to run MHD code 
1. Ammend the initial settings in main.cpp 
2. Compile all the .cpp files listed above 
3. Link the object files together
